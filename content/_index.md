## About Me

**Hi there, and welcome!**

I’m **Marina Lozko**, a passionate and detail-oriented **Senior Software QA Engineer** with over **8 years** of hands-on experience in delivering high-quality software through robust testing strategies and automation frameworks.

With a solid foundation in both **manual and automated QA**, I’ve built and maintained test automation for **web, mobile, and API testing**, helping teams ship reliable products faster. My industry experience spans **enterprise platforms**, **public-facing web applications**, and **mobile technologies**.

I specialize in tools and technologies such as **Selenium**, **Playwright**, **Appium**, **Cypress**, **TestNG**, **Pytest**, **NUnit**, **Cucumber**, and **Gherkin**, and I’m proficient in multiple programming languages including **Python**, **Java**, **C#**, and **JavaScript**.

My workflow integrates tightly with **CI/CD pipelines** using tools like **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, **Jenkins**, and **Docker**, enabling efficient, scalable testing across environments.

I'm a firm believer in **preventing bugs early**, not just catching them. I actively contribute to **shift-left testing**, partner with cross-functional teams, and continuously refine **test strategies, coverage, and performance metrics**.

I thrive in **Agile/Scrum environments**, regularly participating in sprint ceremonies, sprint planning, and demos. I've also mentored QA engineers to help grow team skills and promote a culture of quality.

I'm proud to hold an **ISTQB CTFL v4.0 certification** and a **Master’s Degree in Computer Science**, and I’m always eager to learn, explore new tools, and stay current with best practices in software quality assurance.
