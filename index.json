[{"content":" About Me # Hi there, and welcome!\nI’m Marina Lozko, a passionate and detail-oriented Senior Software QA Engineer with over 8 years of hands-on experience in delivering high-quality software through robust testing strategies and automation frameworks.\nWith a solid foundation in both manual and automated QA, I’ve built and maintained test automation for web, mobile, and API testing, helping teams ship reliable products faster. My industry experience spans enterprise platforms, public-facing web applications, and mobile technologies.\nI specialize in tools and technologies such as Selenium, Playwright, Appium, Cypress, TestNG, Pytest, NUnit, Cucumber, and Gherkin, and I’m proficient in multiple programming languages including Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript.\nMy workflow integrates tightly with CI/CD pipelines using tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and Docker, enabling efficient, scalable testing across environments.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a firm believer in preventing bugs early, not just catching them. I actively contribute to shift-left testing, partner with cross-functional teams, and continuously refine test strategies, coverage, and performance metrics.\nI thrive in Agile/Scrum environments, regularly participating in sprint ceremonies, sprint planning, and demos. I\u0026rsquo;ve also mentored QA engineers to help grow team skills and promote a culture of quality.\nI\u0026rsquo;m proud to hold an ISTQB CTFL v4.0 certification and a Master’s Degree in Computer Science, and I’m always eager to learn, explore new tools, and stay current with best practices in software quality assurance.\n🎓 Certifications # ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL) 📬 Contact # 📧 Email: marinalozkoQA@gmail.com 💼 LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-lozko/ 🌐 GitHub: github.com/MarinaL22 ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"About Me","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
